<h1>jujubee: Run Windows apps in isolation</h1>
<p>Using the win32 api alone. Any Windows application can be ran and launched within jujubee with complete isolation from the system. No virtual machine or container system is needed. Extremely fast, efficient and light on resources. jujubee comes with a virtual file system that uses jujublobs aka virtual disks. jujubees vfs does come with a slight overhead as do all.</p>

<h2>Supported apps:</h2>
<p>The first release of jujubee will support standard exe's only. Windows store apps that run on UWP will need a custom framework which will take time to implement.<p>

<h2>This is a work in progress...</h2>
<p>I use the master branch as my dev. When I have a working program and publish first release ill create a dev branch. </p>
